# Flexible Mutual Information-Based Feature Selection for ML-Based NIDS

## Overview

This project implements flexible mutual information-based feature selection techniques to enhance machine learning models for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The objective is to identify and utilize the most relevant features from the datasets to improve detection accuracy and efficiency.

## Datasets

The following preprocessed and filtered datasets are used in this project:

- **NSL-KDD**: An improved version of the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, addressing inherent issues and providing a balanced set of records for training and testing.
- **ToN-IoT**: A comprehensive dataset for Internet of Things (IoT) security research, containing a variety of attack scenarios and normal traffic, now preprocessed for better analysis.
- **UNSW-NB15**: A modern dataset designed for network intrusion detection, featuring a mix of synthetic and real modern normal and attack traffic, filtered to enhance relevance.
